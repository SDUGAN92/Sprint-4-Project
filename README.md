# Sprint-4-Project
Streamlit Web Application for Vehicle Data Visualization
Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of essential software engineering tasks, designed to enhance your data skills and improve your appeal to prospective employers. The main tasks include establishing and managing Python virtual environments, developing a web application, and deploying it to a publicly accessible cloud service.

The project employed a dataset of car sales advertisements, although the emphasis was not primarily on the dataset or its analysis. You are welcome to select any dataset that piques your interest.

Steps Involved
Step 1: Project Prerequisites
Established a GitHub account and initialized a new repository with README.md and .gitignore files.
Installed required packages such as pandas, streamlit, and plotly-express.
Created a Render.com account and connected it to GitHub.
Installed and configured VS Code, ensuring the Python interpreter aligns with the virtual environment.

Step 2: Data Acquisition
Downloaded the car advertisement dataset (vehicles_us.csv) and positioned it in the root directory of the project.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Developed an EDA.ipynb Jupyter notebook to perform exploratory data analysis.
Generated histograms and scatterplots utilizing the plotly-express library.
The visualizations were initially prototyped in the Jupyter notebook and subsequently integrated into the web application.

Step 4: Web Application Development
Created an app.py file in the root directory of the project.
Imported essential modules such as streamlit, pandas, and plotly_express.
Loaded the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
Incorporated various streamlit components into the application, including headers, histograms, scatter plots, and checkboxes.
Updated the README file to provide a basic project description and instructions for other users to execute the project on their local machines.

Step 5: Deployment to Render
Added a streamlit configuration file to the GitHub repository.
Established a new web service linked to the GitHub repository in Render.
Configured the Render web service
